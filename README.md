# Docker base image for SvxLink

SvxLink is an advanced repeater system software with EchoLink support for Linux
including a GUI, `Qtel - the Qt EchoLink client`. It is a project that develops
software targeting the `ham radio community`. It started out as an EchoLink
application for Linux back in 2003 but has now evolved to be something much more
advanced.

More information about SvxLink is amiable on the [Homepage][1], the
